                <p>Honestly, due to financial issues I had left schooling on 2017 when I was just in 8th grade, and decided never go back to school  and only work and earn only. </p>

                <p>I started working on a computer shop on 2017. It was a wedding card printing shop , doing online form registration, photocopy and many more.</p>

                <p>I used to do photocopy and learn how to do another tasks like - printing wedding cards, doing online registration.</p>

                <p>On that shop, I daily used to observe those children who came for print-outs related summer assignments and they spoke English very quickly while they were same as me ( 16s old girls / boys ) . Inside my soul and heart wanted to school too but my mind used to think that I would not go because fees... ... ... </p>

                <p>As the days passed, the shop owner started treating badly and use bad words. He did not give me enough respect as I used to deserved. I did not had any option because I really wanted to learn their arts, their works and their profession. hahaha..</p>

                <p>One day, a life insurance company agent came for photocopy of his clients documents. After his work he asked my name and educational background, he adviced me , <b>&#34; Beta! Zindgi abhi bahut badi hai, jao abhi thoda aur padh lo. Agar abhi padh loge toh isse acha kaam kar skte ho. &#34;</b>
                    <br /> <br />
                    Honestly, I became so speechless that time because I knew my family situations and his office was on 1st floor of that building and that shop was on ground floor. I was afraid if I did not leave that job , then he might say daily same line to me.  <br /> <br />

                    Finally, I stopped going from next day and never went again nor thought to go again. Because his words totally changed my mind and mindset. ðŸ‘Š

                <p>As we all know, hard work never goes waste and that&#39;s why I stand 1st in my entire village including 2nd in my entire school. That feeling was really amazing and unexplainable. <br /> <br />

                    Honestly, I had set target for 90+ percent but I scored only 88% . I was sad inside for not scoring 90+ . <br />
                    Because for those students who scores 90+ UP Govt gives them enough amount of  money for 11th and 12th (20k rupees) . But I was smiling with 88%.

                <p>On 2020, I started thinking about money, health, wealth and world class success. How to become extremely super successful? I used to watch youtube videos, read blogs and read my first book named <b>&#34; Rich Dad And Poor Dad &#34; by Robert Kiyoshaki</b> .</p>

                <img src={bg} alt="" className='hm' />

                <p>I was very active on Facebook and talk with foreigners in English. I had a lot friends from different countries on 2020.</p>

                <p>On 2020, The government took our land for a canal and gave 2x of land&#39;s price. My grandmother got a big amount of money. She divided between her two sons (my father and his brother). <br /> <br />

                    First of all my father bought double the land in another location. He gifted me a laptop for my 2019s result on 10th.

                <p>I suggested to my father for saving enough amount so that I and my brother can complete our studies well and become whatever we want to be. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, same period of time, I was with a temperary one . My father noticed my all activities the way I used to spend time, the amount of time I study and many more. He observed and rejected my suggestion.</p>

                <p>Finally, My father built our house with rest of money. Because the value of a good house, meaning of a good house and need of a good house, only they can feel who they do not have. We had felt that very well. I was happy with his decision. </p>

                <p>In our house, paiting and wiring could not be completed on that time. I decided to go anywhere where I get any job and continue my software engineering journey.</p>

                <p>I joined a Tally Class (Accounting Software) at hometown so that whenever I go in city. I can get computer related jobs easily in city.</p>
                <p>Before I complete Tally Course, my friends informed me about a job in Bangalore. I did not think a moment and directly confirmed to go there. .... </p>
