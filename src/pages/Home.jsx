                <p>Honestly, due to financial issues I had left schooling on 2017 when I was just in 8th grade, and decided never go back to school  and only work and earn only. </p>

                <p>I started working on a computer shop on 2017. It was a wedding card printing shop , doing online form registration, photocopy and many more.</p>

                <p>I used to do photocopy and learn how to do another tasks like - printing wedding cards, doing online registration.</p>

                <p>On that shop, I daily used to observe those children who came for print-outs related summer assignments and they spoke English very quickly while they were same as me ( 16s old girls / boys ) . Inside my soul and heart wanted to school too but my mind used to think that I would not go because fees... ... ... </p>

                <p>As the days passed, the shop owner started treating badly and use bad words. He did not give me enough respect as I used to deserved. I did not had any option because I really wanted to learn their arts, their works and their profession. hahaha..</p>

                <p>One day, a life insurance company agent came for photocopy of his clients documents. After his work he asked my name and educational background, he adviced me , <b>&#34; Beta! Zindgi abhi bahut badi hai, jao abhi thoda aur padh lo. Agar abhi padh loge toh isse acha kaam kar skte ho. &#34;</b>
                    <br /> <br />
                    Honestly, I became so speechless that time because I knew my family situations and his office was on 1st floor of that building and that shop was on ground floor. I was afraid if I did not leave that job , then he might say daily same line to me.  <br /> <br />

                    Finally, I stopped going from next day and never went again nor thought to go again. Because his words totally changed my mind and mindset. ðŸ‘Š

                <p>As we all know, hard work never goes waste and that&#39;s why I stand 1st in my entire village including 2nd in my entire school. That feeling was really amazing and unexplainable. <br /> <br />

                    Honestly, I had set target for 90+ percent but I scored only 88% . I was sad inside for not scoring 90+ . hahaha ðŸ˜‚ <br />
                    Because for those students who scores 90+ UP Govt gives them enough amount of  money for 11th and 12th (20k rupees) . But I was smiling with 88%. ( Greedy Mind! ðŸ¤£ )
