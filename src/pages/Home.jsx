                <p className='tj'>Honestly, due to financial issues I had left schooling on 2017 when I was just in 8th grade, and decided never go back to school  and only work and earn only. </p>

                <p className='tj'>I started working on a computer shop on 2017. It was a wedding card printing shop , doing online form registration, photocopy and many more.</p>

                <p className='tj'>I used to do photocopy and learn how to do another tasks like - printing wedding cards, doing online registration.</p>

                <p className='tj'>On that shop, I daily used to observe those children who came for print-outs related summer assignments and they spoke English very quickly while they were same as me ( 16s old girls / boys ) . Inside my soul and heart wanted to school too but my mind used to think that I would not go because fees... ... ... </p>

                <p className='tj'>As the days passed, the shop owner started treating badly and use bad words. He did not give me enough respect as I used to deserved. I did not had any option because I really wanted to learn their arts, their works and their profession. hahaha..üòÇ I listened all those insulting words silently because I wanted to learn all those works which they used to do for their business.</p>
                <img src={bg2} alt="" className='hm' />

                <p className='tj'>One day, a life insurance company agent came for photocopy of his clients documents. After his work he asked my name and educational background, he adviced me , <b>&#34; Beta! Zindgi abhi bahut badi hai, jao abhi thoda aur padh lo. Agar abhi padh loge toh isse acha kaam kar skte ho. &#34;</b>
                    <br /> <br />
                    Honestly, I became so speechless that time because I knew my family situations and his office was on 1st floor of that building and that shop was on ground floor. I was afraid if I did not leave that job , then he might say daily same line to me.  <br /> <br />

                    Finally, I stopped going from next day and never went again nor thought to go again. Because his words totally changed my mind and mindset. üëä

                <h3>#Results - Year 2019</h3>

                <p className='tj'>After leaving that job on 2017, I decided  to study seriosly because I had only one key to open the door of financial freedom (Being Rich) and I made so many rules for myself, schedule (time-tables) and set targets for each subjects. </p>

                <p className='tj'>I got 4th position in 8th grade, 3rd in 9th grade. I just followed only what my favorite teacher told me to do.</p>

                <p className='tj'>Everyone was excited for my 10th marks because I was famous in whole school and in my village as a good boy who really did not care about others and their opinions. </p>


                <div className="gallery">
                    <img src={b1} alt="the main reason" />

                    <img src={b4} alt="the main reason" />
                </div>

                <p className='tj'>As we all know, hard work never goes waste and that&#39;s why I got 1st position in my entire village and 2nd in my entire school. That feeling was really amazing and unexplainable. Because I saw in my village, everyone rich or middle class started using my name to encourage their children for focusing on study and being like me to do same like me . <br /> <br />


                    Honestly, I had set target for 90+ percent but I scored only 88% . I was sad inside for not scoring 90+ . <br />
                    Because for those students who scores 90+ UP Govt gives them enough amount of  money for 11th and 12th (20k rupees) . I took admission in one Govt. College for 11th and 12th . This school was 12km away from my home in  town.

                </div>

                <p className='tj'>After 10th results, I wanted to feel same feeling again by doing something different from others. I always set everything higher than my surrounding boys, like - my dreams, my lifestyle and many more. I had hobby of looking different, doing different and being different.</p>

                <p className='tj'>I had spent my childhood in poverty. I always used to think -  <br /> How can I help poor people? <br /> How to be enough rich to help others? </p>

                <p className='tj'>On 2020, I started thinking about money, health, wealth and world class success. How to become extremely super successful? I used to watch youtube videos, read blogs and found my favorite book named <b>&#34; Rich Dad And Poor Dad &#34; by Robert Kiyoshaki</b> .</p>

                <img src={bg} alt="" className='hm' />

                <p className='tj'>I was very active on Facebook and talk with foreigners in English. I had a lot friends from different countries on 2020.</p>
                <p className='tj'>I had no friends in real life those days because I always of think of 5% club mindset. I was very interested in talking about business and technology.</p>

                <p className='tj'>My words did not suit on me and mostly same age boys used to call me - &#34;Crazy&#34;. Because that time I did not have even a good house nor good clothes. That is why no one believed me.</p>

                <p className='tj'>This was big reason why I did not add Indians in my Facebook because of mindset and selfish nature.</p>
                <img src={bg3} alt="" className='hm' />

                <p className='tj'>On 2020, There was a water canal going through west side of our village. It was crossing our land too. The government took our land to include in  canal and gave 2x amount of our land&#39;s price. My grandmother got a big amount of money. She divided between her two sons (my father and his brother).
                </p>

                <p className='tj'>After getting his part, my father discussed with us in family and shared his plans how he would spend those money. Firstly, he wanted to bring back our land because our main income source was farming. He did not has any business experience so he wanted to avoid business. Secodly, he wanted to build a good house because we did not have a good house those days. We used to face many problems in rainy days, there were many problems in rainy days for us like - cooking, eating, sleeping, studying and etc.</p>

                </div>

                <p className='tj'>I suggested to my father for saving enough amount because I wanted to pursue BCA and became a software engineer. That time he said - <b>&#34; Okay! , I&#39;ll do whatever I can do for your dreams.&#34;</b> </p>

                <p className='tj'> Unfortunately, same period of time, I fall in love with one foreigner girl. Because we used to encourage each other and inspire each other for being successful and achieve our dreams whatever we had set. </p>
                <p className='tj'>I purposed her, she accepted me and I told everything to my mother and father. I requested them to accept her as my wife. They agreed with me and said to focus on study only.</p>
                <p className='tj'>I started breaking my all rules, time tables just for her so that we could build a happy and productive relationship for our successful future. Because a relationship requires a lot of time, efforts , emotions, feelings, support and understading.</p>
                <p className='tj'>My father noticed my all activities the way I used to spend time, the amount of time I study and many more. He observed me very well. My father had doubt that I could not have good career in anything now because I was in relationship and most of my time were used to talk with her.</p>

                <p className='tj'>Finally, I got 82% only in 12th. I requested to my father not to spend too much over house and just repair normal only because I wanted to pursue BCA from any famous College or University and It cost higher amount of money for fees.</p>

                <p className='tj'>If I left that girl on that time, she might get hurt. It would be cheating on her. I had made so many promises. I treated her as my wife because she always encouraged and inspired me for being me and pursuing my dreams.</p>

                <p className='tj'>Finally, My father built our house with rest of money. Because the value of a good house, meaning of a good house and need of a good house, only they can feel who they do not have. We had felt that very well. I was happy with his decision. </p>

                <p className='tj'>I had one classmate with same level mindset and dreams. We used to talk a lot. He was topper in school till 8th grade. He had same long distance relationship. His girlfriend was from Banaras. Her father was a policeman. She wanted to be an IPS Officer. </p>
                <img src={bg5} alt="" className='hm' />

                <p className='tj'>I and he met on the last day of 12th. It was practical for physics. We all classmates used to talk each other and ask for future decisions and steps. I found that he was one only boy who wanted to pursue BCA too. I smiled and went near to him. His village was just 3km aways from mine. After few days, we became very close friend.</p>

                <img src={bg7} alt="" className='hm' />
                <p className='tj'>I and my friend decided not to do any degrees because it cost a lot and we just focus on skills what we need to start our own company. We planned to go New Delhi so that we could learn coding and do part time jobs. But we didn&#39;t have any skills. We joined Tally Course Class. Tally is software for company management or small business management. We wanted to do job related to computer. </p>

                <p className='tj'>In that institute, we met one another boy. He was Nepali and also having Indian Citizenship. He became our very close friend. Now we were 3 boys. With same mindset and same level dream.</p>
                <img src={bg6} alt="" className='hm' />

                <p className='tj'>Before we complete Tally Course, one night that Nepali friend informed us about one job in Bangaluru. I said to go there because I really wanted to do anything (any job) for money that time. Bangaluru is  2000km+ away from our hometown. Without any delay, without any fear, we went next day on station and purchased tickets for Bangaluru.</p>

                <p className='tj'>I was just 19s year old boy that time. I did not feel fear because I loved that girl with my heart and soul. I was feeling very positive and motivated. Because she always showed her support, love, care and encouragement to me. We 3 friends left home for  Bangaluru on 18th October 2021.   </p>

                <p className='tj'>
                    We worked 5 months there. It was 12 hrs job and we used to do overtime (day-night continue). It was mine first job so I do it with passion and motivation because we had planned to learn coding in Hyderabad after saving enough. So that we can afford fees and room expenses.
                </p>

                <p className='tj'>During those days my <b>true love</b> started showing me her <b>true color</b>. Nothing teaches us better than <b>fears, tears and years</b>. I made mistakes and my mistakes made me. In short - &#34; It feels like hell, I wanted to come back at home but I had made decision, so I did not want to go home with empty hands at any cost no matter how hard it gets and feels. &#34;</p>

                <p className='tj'>I could not complete course because of my personal choices, decisions and mistakes as well as mental state. I failed to learn coding there, but I learnt something that I would never forget for my lifetime.</p>

                <p className='tj'>I had completely understood that I walked the wrong path. The path seperated me from my family. I did not break my promises. I kept holding even my soul and heart wanted to leave and break all those promises.</p>

                <p className='tj'>I came back home on 4rd November 2022. I was totally different myself. I was so silent. No smile, No six abs, No Fitness, No Motivation same like - &#34;a walking dead body&#34;.  </p>

                <p className='tj'>I contacted with my current room partners because I had met with them in Hyderabad during coding classes . One of them lives just 3km away from my village.</p>

                <p className='tj'>I remembered my childhood and set my family as my motivation again, on 18th February 2023, I came here Noida. I was sick very badly as I started feeling well I continued learning coding again from YouTube and Educational Websites.</p>

                <p className='tj'>After few days, I became very aggresive nature boy. Because I had to call &#34;Sir&#34; to guys who they really did not deserve it.They were very cheap level mindset, they used to do mostly  s*xual discussion and running behind girls and their beauty.  </p>

                <p className='tj'>After few days, she (ex) came back again and she started talking again. She started supporting and encouraging me again same way. I thought that she had changed now but I was wrong because she was same.</p>

My confidence was low. I felt so down and negative those day for not making those progress, growths, results that I had set for 2023 .</p>

                <p className='tj'>Before I forgot anything, I met one another girl. At our first talk, I felt something in my heart and suddenly I sent her fried request. She was an Indian and also Hindu. I used to feel like - she is need of my soul because I feel so relax with her . I did not know why ? But I used to feel a godly power and a relaxing positive energy. </p>

<p className='tj'>when she did not come online, I used to miss her a lot and wait her to talk because I really fall in love with her personality. But as she come online, I suddenly used to go offline because of fear to tell the truth about myself. Because I have weakness of speaking the truth. I cannot make fool others nor I can cheat others. I ignored her a lot and I represseted myself in front her like - I do not have feelings or desires of loving someone or being loved by someone.  </p>

                    In my mind, my past was running, because no matter how much you love someone, if you are not enough well financially, you will lose your love . In India, girl&#39;s family does not see the boys love for their girls, they see only the position that boys hold and the success they have, then they allow to do love marriage, I did not have my own phone, I did not have a lot fancy dresses, my call center salary was so low. There were a lot of things those create self-doubts in my mind.

                      <p className='tj'>I was changing myself for her so that her family might accept me as her life partner without any problems. I left my call center job on <b>Diwali</b> and said to myself - &#34; No More Negative Environment, Only Those Important Things Which Could Help Me To Produce Results In 2 Years! &#34; <br /> <br />
                      
                      I changed my job and joined a mobile phone assembling company , my salary was more than call center (depends on overtime). I always tried to hide my family background and look like I&#39;m a rich boy. I always used to share everything my past lessons, mistakes, good qualities , good memories because I really wanted to spend my entire life with her. 
                      </p>

                      <p className='tj'>Soon, I realized that she did not share more information about her like I shared with her. She just read and reply.
                      
                      One negative thought came in my mind, I decided not to come online no matter what happened. But It was the beginning of the end of my heartfelt love story. </p>

                <h3>#Consistency - Year 2024</h3>
                <p className='tj'>I tried to explain everything but it was so late. She got hurt by me. Her trust got broken for me. She did not want listen me while I tried many times.</p>

                <p className='tj'>But I have been changed myself and my things those were the reason of self doubts. In January, I purchased new phone,  one book and return my friend&#39;s phone with almost half price of phone so that I can remove all reasons of self-doubts . I want to feel positive, motivated and rich again. <br /> <br />
                
                I have changed my hobbies - I read book less and I make time to watch family based movies. So that I can improve my relationship with her . I am waiting for her one forgiveness but she is not ready to forgive me. </p>

                <img src={rk} alt="" className='hm' />

                <p className='tj'>I do daily prayers for solving all our misunderstanding. But I do not know, when will god listen? when will god solve our relationship issues? <br /> <br />
                
                Only I and God know, How much I really love her. How heartily I do prayers for her. But I don&#39;t want to let her to stress or to think too much. because overthinking kills our happiness, peace of mind and productivity. I do not message her but I daily miss her so much. <b>Krishna ji, kya garib hona paap hai? yaa garibi me pyar karna paap hai? life me kya ho rha hai kuch samjh me nhi aa rha. himmat nhi hota dubara message krne ko... aur raha bhi nhi ja rha bina message kiye...</b></p>
